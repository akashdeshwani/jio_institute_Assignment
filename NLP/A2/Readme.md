Hello Students,

For sentence parsing, you can use NLTK or Stanford libraries (https://opensource.com/article/20/8/intro-python-nltk). For ingredient extraction, first, create ingredients vocabulary, then apply regular expressions, or use the NER tool. For preliminary work, you can use https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanishk307/6000-indian-food-recipes-dataset?select=IndianFoodDatasetCSV.csv this dataset. Once your code works on samples from the dataset mentioned above, you can add web scraping functionality.
