Dataset file name used -> "gg2015.json"
link of dataset -> https://jioinstitute1-my.sharepoint.com/personal/bharath3_reddy_jioinstitute_edu_in/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fbharath3%5Freddy%5Fjioinstitute%5Fedu%5Fin%2FDocuments%2FDocuments%2FAcademic%20Services%2Fgg2015%2Ejson%2Ezmdownload&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fbharath3%5Freddy%5Fjioinstitute%5Fedu%5Fin%2FDocuments%2FDocuments%2FAcademic%20Services&ct=1668018477487&or=OWA%2DNT&cid=b8a3705f%2D7980%2D6cd4%2Dadef%2Dcc289cb7abcf&ga=1

Note -> To run the code, you have to change the datafile name same as "gg2015.json" and keep it in the same folder.


## Approach

For the 1st 2 week of the project we applied only regex to solve the problem but we were not getting accuracy more than 60% so we decided to use NLP techniques to solve the problem.
We tried to learn multiple libraries like NLTK, Spacy, TextBlob, etc. but we were not able to apply them on our dataset correctly so we decided look for some tutorials on youtube which were very helpful.
We used spaCy library to solve the problem. 

We have shared both the code files in the zip. 

Regex code file name -> "NLP_submission_1.ipynb" solution -> within ipynb file only.
spaCy code file name -> "NLP_submission_2.ipynb" solution -> within ipynb file and answers1.json
