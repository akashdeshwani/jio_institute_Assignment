1.	Detection and Prevention of Telecom Fraud (Capstone project): 
Objective: There is huge financial loss in telecom industry due to fraudulent activities by fraudsters. It’s a world-wide problem which impact the annual revenue losses for many subscribers and telecom service providers. Herculean efforts are made to improve the fraud detection techniques still the loopholes are accessible by fraudsters. Traditional methods involving manual detection are time consuming, expensive, and inaccurate. To achieve effective and feasible detection for telecom fraud user, the proposal of this AI model based on the subscriber CDRs (Call detail records) helps to prevent as well as detect the fraud of telecom. The real time dataset is going to be evaluated and to be used for this model creation. The main aim is to increase the accuracy of fraud detection using the Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques and, hence reduces the loss incurred by the telecommunication companies from fraud users.
(Note: Still in progress in Research phase)
Skills Used: Classification| ML | Federated learning | Anomaly detection.
2.	Sepsis data prediction and analysis: 
The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 aimed to address the need for early detection and treatment of sepsis by facilitating the development of open-source algorithms for sepsis recognition from clinical data. The challenge addressed issues such as inconsistent patient cohorts, clinical variables, and evaluation metrics in previous sepsis detection methods. Using classical ML model to predict the onset of sepsis disease before 6 hours.
the recall value of 69.35% means that we can successfully identify almost 7 patients out of 10 that will develop a sepsis within the next 6 hours after the laboratory analyses were performed. 
Skills Used: Feature Engineering | Feature Extraction | Feature Selection |  LGBM | Random Forest Classifier | XGboost | Regression 

3.	Prediction of Customer churn using telecom data: 
Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. With the help of ML classification algorithms, we are going to predict the Churn.
Skill Used: Logistic Regression | Random Forest | EDA | Feature Engineering.
4.	Responsible AI: 
The HR Department Attrition Rate Analysis using Responsible AI project aims to analyse and understand the reasons for high attrition rates within a company's HR department. The project will utilize advanced AI algorithms and machine learning techniques to process and analyse large amounts of HR data, including employee turnover records, employee surveys, and other relevant information. The ultimate goal of the project is to identify the key factors contributing to high attrition rates in the HR department and provide actionable insights to help the company reduce turnover and improve employee satisfaction and retention.
Skill Used: Fairness | Reject Option Classifier | XAI | Proxy and PII data | differential privacy
5.	Abstract Art Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks: 
The project is Abstract Art Generating AI built using TensorFlow produces Awesome Abstract Images given Input Images using Generative Adversarial Network. 
Skill Used: GAN’s | TensorFlow | Keras

6.	Data Visualization workshop presentation: 
PROBLEM There has an abundance of crimes committed on a daily basis in Chicago, one of the most populated states in the United States. In this project, we use Chicago Crime dataset which reflects reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2012 to 2016. Our goal is to help the Chicago police department and local public by identifying the most occurring crimes, observe the trend over the years, and find the highly prone crime areas. To prepare a dashboard using tableau on “Analysis of Chicago Crime in Tableau”.
Skill Used: Tableau | Data Visualization. 
7.	Design a Data Lake and develop queries to find key insights about market, products and customers: 
Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits. In the first step of this data science project, we will perform data exploration. We will import the essential packages required for this role and then read our data. Finally, we will go through the input data to gain necessary insights about it. 
Skill Used: pyspark| DataLake | Databricks | BigData 
8.	Twitter data Analysis using NLP: 
This project aims to use NLP methods to identify the presenters, nominees, awards, winners and hosts for a given award ceremony. Overall goal of our project was generalizing the strategies so that they will be applicable to any other award ceremony besides the Golden Globes. Although this model is only trained or build on tweets for the Golden Globes we are sure that it will also perform good on other award ceremonies.
Skills Used: NLTK | SpaCy | PosTagging | Regex

9.	Recipe bot using NLP: 
This project aims to convert a recipe from AllRecipes.com into another recipe with a different style or cuisine. We parse the HTML code into an internal representation using semantic NLP techniques.
Skills Used: Beautiful Soup | POS tagging | Regular expressions | TKinter | Bigram
